There is a 10 question, 2 x 5-type form with corresponding data
There is a second different XML file to demonstrate that the system works with a different XML file

**JS**
the examen form has a comprehensive JS script which takes care of the dynamics of th epage, includes a countdown timer and a final score. It also onforms if each question has been _correctly_ answered or _wrongly_, in which case it offers the correct solution.
